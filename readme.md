# Welcome to CSS and SASS repo
This repo demonstrates how SASS can be make CSS design simpler and make the workflow efficient.
## Install Sass

You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for
your operating system [from GitHub][] and [adding it to your `PATH`][PATH].
That's allâ€”there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to
install.

[from GitHub]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases
[PATH]: https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/

If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using [npm][] by running

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

```
npm install -g sass
```


See [the Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more ways to install
Sass.

Once you have Sass installed, you can run the `sass` executable to compile
`.sass` and `.scss` files to `.css` files. For example:

```
sass source/stylesheets/style.scss build/stylesheets/style.css
```
