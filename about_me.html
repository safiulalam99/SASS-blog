       <p>I am a software enginnering student at TAMK. I am just going to 
         typing some random stuff to fill this section out. I know people won't read this
         but if you did, seriously why? Just kidding! i do appreciate it though.
         Took me some time to write it. Does not feel like it was all a waste.
